🧱 Suggested Sentence Structure
Part 1:
【Subject】＋【location】＋【existence verb】

Part 2:
【Subject】＋【object】＋【verb (past)】＋【question marker】？

Hint: The subject is “you” in part 2, and the object is “garbage”.

🔍 Clues to Build the Sentence
For "Bears are at the door":
Use the verb that expresses existence of living things.

The door is the location, and bears are the subject.

Which particle usually marks location of existence?

For "Did you leave the garbage out?":
You’ll need to use past tense for the verb.

Which verb better fits “leave something somewhere”? (Look at "おく" and "のこす")

Think about the direction or place where the garbage was left (hint: outside).

End with a question marker appropriate for informal or polite form.

❓ Follow-up Questions You Might Need Help With:
Which particle should mark the subject of existence (like the bears)?

How do I use “いる” to express location of animals?

How do I conjugate “おく” into past tense?

How do I form a yes/no question in Japanese?

What is the difference between “のこす” and “おく”?

How do I say “outside the house” naturally in Japanese?

Let’s try building the sentence now! Start with part 1:
How would you say "Bears are at the door"?
Give it a try, and I’ll help guide you.

### Assistant Output

Perfect! Let’s begin with your sentence:
“Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?”
We’ll break it into two parts and walk through it step by step.

📘 Vocabulary Table
| Japanese | Romanji | English |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| くま | kuma| bear |
| ドア| doa| door|
| ごみ| gomi| garbage|
|出す| dasu| to put out|
|いる| iru | to exist (living)
| 外| soto| outside|
| のこす| nokosu| to leave behind|

🧩 Sentence Structure
Part 1 – “Bears are at the door”
doa **_ kuma _** iru

Part 2 – “Did you leave the garbage out?”
anata **_ gomi _** soto **_ dasu _** ka

🕵️ Clues and Considerations
You’re talking about a location where something (living) exists, so focus on which particle connects a location to an existing being.

The subject of existence (bears) needs a subject-marking particle.

“Put the garbage out” involves direction or location towards outside. Think about what particle expresses direction or destination.

The action is past tense, and a question, so your final verb needs to be past tense and end in ka.

For “leave the garbage out,” you can also think of the alternative verb "leave behind", but it's okay to stick with "put out" at beginner level.

Let’s now try it!
Take a shot at Part 1 or Part 2—or both—in romanji.

Once you submit, I’ll interpret what you wrote aloud (so you can hear what you're really saying) and guide you from there.
